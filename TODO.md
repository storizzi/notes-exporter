# To Do

Some features that might be useful to include in the future in no particular order:

* Ensure non-image files can also be downloaded to attachments (this isn't available in the API so some hackery would be needed)
* Filter to specify specific accounts / notebooks
* If use short form of parameters should be able to specify parameter without true implicitly
* Option to NOT overwrite files / warn if going to do so
* Clear down directory before download (optionally)
* Allow for mailbox and then notebook directory structure
* Filter to only include files that have been changed after a specific date
* Option to put images at the same level as documents instead of a subdirectory
* Option to group images at the account level
* Option to group images at the notebook level
* Optionally put proper HTML page tags around the pages so they are properly formatted (e.g. with the title as the original note title)
* Optionally share images so they are not being duplicated
* Let the different format files be output in different directories to the default - params + env vars
* Optionally delete notes after they have been downloaded (e.g. for migration purposes)
* Possible to change files and sync them back?? json metadata could include the filestamp when it was written) - e.g. convert from markdown to html with embedded data and update / create note
* Consider exports from other note taking applications - e.g. Evernote - Apple Notes does have an import, but embedded non-image files are still a problem - perhaps we could sync export from enex files and files imported into Apple Notes in some way
